# Benchmarking gene embeddings from sequence, expression, network, and text models for functional prediction tasks
This repository contains code and datasets for benchmarking 38 gene embedding methods across functional prediction tasks, including gene attribute, interaction, and set relationship predictions, using data from amino acid sequences, gene expression, PPI networks, and biomedical literature.

## Organization
This repo is organized into several sections, part of which is stored on zenodo.
- `data`: contains ... on zenodo
- `src`: contains the code used for related tasks to preprocess the embeddings and benchmakr them across our three main functional prediction tasks
